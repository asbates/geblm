  thin = 1, lambda_prior_shape, lambda_prior_rate, start_theta)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{formula}{A formula describing the model fit. Passed to
\code{\link[lme4:lmer]{lme4::lmer}} to construct model matrices.}

\item{burnin}{Number of burn in iterations}

\item{iterations}{Number of sampling iterations}

\item{thin}{Number of thinning iterations}

\item{lambda_prior_shape}{(Optional) Shape parameter for the prior on the
precision of the error term and random effects, in that order. Defaults
to \code{c(0, -0.5)}.}

\item{lambda_prior_rate}{(Optional) Rate parameter for the prior on the
precision of the error term and random effects, in that order. Defaults
to \code{c(0, 0)}.}

\item{start_theta}{(Optional) Starting vector for
\eqn{\theta = (\beta' u')'}, the concatenation of the fixed and random
effects coefficients. Defaults to the frequentist estimate.}
}
\value{
A list containing MCMC samples from the posterior distributions of
 the fixed effects, random effects, and standard deviations for the error
 term and fixed effects.

\description{
Fits a Bayesian linear mixed model with a flat prior on beta and improper
    gamma prior on the precision lambda for the fixed effects and error term.
    A standard reference prior for lambda is used by default. The formula
    syntax is the same as \code{\link[lme4:lmer]{lme4::lmer}} which is used
    to obtain the model matrices. Only a singleintercept is supported for
    the random effects.
}
\section{Warning}{

We leave it to the user to ensure only a single intercept is specified
    in the model formula.
