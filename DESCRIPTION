Description: Posterior samples for Bayesian linear models via geometrically
    convergent Gibbs samplers. Linear models with a proper normal-gamma prior
    are supported as well as linear mixed models with both improper and proper
    priors. Geometric ergodicity of the Gibbs samplers allow for computation of
    MCMC standard error estimates.
